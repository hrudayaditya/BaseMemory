# Adding Language Support

This guide is meant to be usable by both humans and coding agents.

## Agent-ready brief

If you want an agent to implement a new language, give it this guide plus a request like:

> Add semantic parsing support for `<language>`.
> If the grammar makes call extraction practical, add `call_graph` support too.
> Update tests and docs, then run `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test:run`.

The agent should treat this as a staged task:

1. confirm file discovery
2. register the language
3. add parser support
4. add parser tests
5. verify
6. optionally add call-graph support
7. update docs
8. re-run verification

## The only caveat

This guide removes **repo-specific** guesswork. It does **not** replace knowledge of the target language’s tree-sitter grammar.

The implementer still needs to know or look up:

- the grammar crate
- the parser constant
- the node kinds for declarations, comments, and calls

So this guide is a **repo wiring guide**, not a replacement for the target language's tree-sitter grammar docs.

## Pick the support level first

There are three support levels in this repo:

1. **File discovery only** — files are indexed, but may fall back to line-based chunking
2. **Semantic parsing** — tree-sitter extracts better chunks for search
3. **Call graph support** — `call_graph` can extract callers/callees too

If you are unsure, aim for **semantic parsing first**. It is much easier to land than full call-graph support.

## Definition of done

### Semantic parsing support is done when:

- the language is registered in `native/src/types.rs`
- files in that language are discovered by the indexer
- `native/src/parser.rs` uses the correct tree-sitter grammar
- semantic chunks are produced for the main declaration types
- `tests/native.test.ts` covers the language
- docs are updated if user-facing support claims changed
- `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test:run` all pass

### Call-graph support is done when:

- a `native/queries/<language>-calls.scm` file exists
- `native/src/call_extractor.rs` routes the language correctly
- `src/indexer/index.ts` includes the language in `CALL_GRAPH_LANGUAGES`
- `src/indexer/index.ts` includes the relevant declaration chunk types in `CALL_GRAPH_SYMBOL_CHUNK_TYPES`
- `tests/call-graph.test.ts` covers the supported call/query forms
- full verification passes again

## Files to change

### Always relevant

- `src/config/constants.ts` — file extensions included in indexing
- `native/src/types.rs` — language enum and string/extension mapping
- `native/src/parser.rs` — tree-sitter parser wiring, semantic node kinds, comment kinds
- `tests/native.test.ts` — parser coverage

### Only for call-graph support

- `native/src/call_extractor.rs` — call extraction routing
- `native/queries/<language>-calls.scm` — tree-sitter query file
- `src/indexer/index.ts` — call-graph language + symbol chunk-type allowlists
- `tests/call-graph.test.ts` — call-graph coverage

### Usually update too

- `README.md` — supported-language claims

## Recommended order

1. **Confirm file discovery** in `src/config/constants.ts`
2. **Register the language** in `native/src/types.rs`
3. **Add parser support** in `native/src/parser.rs`
4. **Add one parser test** in `tests/native.test.ts`
5. Run `npm run build` and `npm run test:run`
6. Only then add **call-graph support**
7. Update docs

That order keeps failures easy to localize.

## Fast implementation checklist

Use this exact sequence:

- [ ] Check whether the extensions are already present in `src/config/constants.ts`
- [ ] Add the language to `Language`, `from_extension()`, `as_str()`, and `from_string()` in `native/src/types.rs`
- [ ] Add the grammar crate in `native/Cargo.toml` if needed
- [ ] Add parser selection, comment node kinds, and semantic node kinds in `native/src/parser.rs`
- [ ] Add one parser test in `tests/native.test.ts`
- [ ] Run `npm run build` and `npm run test:run`
- [ ] If call graph is needed, add `native/queries/<language>-calls.scm`
- [ ] Wire the language into `native/src/call_extractor.rs`
- [ ] Add the language and chunk types to `src/indexer/index.ts`
- [ ] Add call-graph tests in `tests/call-graph.test.ts`
- [ ] Update `README.md` if supported-language claims changed
- [ ] Run full verification: `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:run`

## What each file needs

### `src/config/constants.ts`

Add extensions **only if they are not already included**.

Important: discovery here does **not** mean semantic parsing is supported.

### `native/src/types.rs`

Add the language to:

- `Language`
- `from_extension()`
- `as_str()`
- `from_string()`

This is the canonical registry.

### `native/src/parser.rs`

Add the language in three places:

- parser selection in `parse_file_internal()`
- `is_comment_node()`
- `is_semantic_node()`

Start with narrow, declaration-like nodes:

- functions
- methods
- classes / structs
- interfaces / traits
- enums
- modules / namespaces

Avoid broad container nodes unless the grammar gives you no better option.

### `tests/native.test.ts`

Add a small test proving the main declaration type becomes a chunk.

## Call-graph support checklist

If the language should support `call_graph`, do all of this:

### `native/queries/<language>-calls.scm`

Create a query file modeled after the existing ones.

Use the same capture names already expected by `native/src/call_extractor.rs`:

- `@callee.name`
- `@call`
- `@constructor`
- `@import.name`
- `@import.default`
- `@import.namespace`

Start small:

- direct calls
- method/member calls
- imports/includes if applicable

### `native/src/call_extractor.rs`

Add the language to:

- parser selection
- query-source selection
- `method_parent_kinds` if needed

### `src/indexer/index.ts`

Add the language to `CALL_GRAPH_LANGUAGES` and add relevant declaration chunk types to `CALL_GRAPH_SYMBOL_CHUNK_TYPES`.

Those chunk-type strings must match the tree-sitter node kinds that actually become chunks in `native/src/parser.rs`.

### `tests/call-graph.test.ts`

Add focused tests for the constructs your query file supports.

## Common failure modes

### Files are indexed, but results are poor

The extension is included, but the language is not wired in `types.rs` and `parser.rs`, so indexing falls back to line-based chunks.

### Build fails after adding a grammar crate

Usually the crate name, parser constant, or grammar version is wrong.

### Parsing works, but chunks are noisy or missing

`is_semantic_node()` is using the wrong node kinds.

### Comments do not attach to chunks

`is_comment_node()` is using the wrong comment node kinds.

### `extract_calls()` returns nothing

The query file, query registration, or query node names do not match the grammar.

Also check that the query capture names match what `native/src/call_extractor.rs` expects.

### Call extraction works, but `call_graph` is still empty

The language is missing from `CALL_GRAPH_LANGUAGES` or its symbol chunk types are missing from `CALL_GRAPH_SYMBOL_CHUNK_TYPES` in `src/indexer/index.ts`.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:run
```

For partial progress while implementing, the minimum useful checkpoint is:

```bash
npm run build
npm run test:run
```

## Practical note for PHP

`php` files are already included in `src/config/constants.ts`, but PHP is not yet wired in `native/src/types.rs`, `native/src/parser.rs`, or `native/queries/`.

So a PHP PR is mainly a **semantic parsing** change, with **optional call-graph support**.

## One-line summary

If you know how to inspect a tree-sitter grammar, this guide should be enough to add a language in this repo without guessing where the plumbing lives.
